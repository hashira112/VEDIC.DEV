    <h2>PLOT:</h2>
    <p>In a world where hunters, humans who possess magical abilities, must battle deadly monsters to protect the human race from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds himself in a seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the extremely rare ability to level up in strength, possibly beyond any known limits. Follow Jinwoo's journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers.</p>
    <h3>CHARACTERS:</h3>
    <p1>"Sung Jinwoo"<br>
  ->Sung Jinwoo (성진우) is the main protagonist of series. Originally an infamous weak E-Rank hunter, he gets the chance of a lifetime when he is selected as the Player of a magical program called the System and gains the unique ability to grow in strength without limit. By taking advantage of this new power offered to him by the System, Jinwoo eventually rises up to become humanity's greatest hunter, but also finds himself locked in a war that has been going on forever between the Rulers and the Monarchs, two groups of godlike beings who have their own agendas with mankind.<br>

    "Yoo Jinho"<br>
   ->Yoo Jinho (유진호) is a Korean D-Rank Hunter and Jinwoo's best friend. He comes from a very rich family and eventually becomes the vice chairman of Jinwoo's guild after he manages to impress the latter with his loyalty and commitment. Jinho also has the odd habit of dressing up in very fancy and expensive armor, which serves as a prominent running gag throughout the series.<br>

    "Sung Jinah"<br>
    ->Sung Jinah (성진아) is Jinwoo's younger, teenage sister. Unlike her brother, she is a completely normal human with no magical abilities whatsoever.<br>

    "Park Kyung-Hye"<br>
    ->Park Kyung-Hye (박경혜) is Jinwoo and Jinah's loving mother. Four years before the events of the main storyline, she suddenly became ill with Eternal Slumber, an incurable and magically-induced sleeping disorder, and fell into a coma soon after, forcing Jinwoo to take over as the breadwinner of the family in her place. However, about four years later, Jinwoo was able to cure her condition and wake her up by using a rare potion he crafted while training with the System. Much like her daughter, Kyung-Hye is a completely normal human with no magical abilities whatsoever.<br>

    "Lee Joohee"<br>
    ->Lee Joohee (이주희) is a Korean B-Rank hunter who specializes in healing magic and one of Jinwoo's friends during his days as an E-Rank Hunter. Although she survives the double dungeon alongside Jinwoo, she is left shell-shocked by the experience and ultimately retires after failing to overcome her mental trauma.<br>

    "Cha Hae-In"<br>
    ->Cha Hae-In (차해인) is a Korean S-Rank Hunter who specializes in swordsmanship and the only female S-Rank in the country. She has an odd condition that causes other hunters to smell foul to her and eventually develops romantic feelings for Jinwoo after witnessing him in action and discovering that he is the only hunter she has ever met who actually smells nice.<br>

    "Sung Il-Hwan"<br>
    ->Sung Il-Hwan (성일환) was a Korean S-Rank Hunter, Kyung-Hye's husband, and Jinwoo and Jinah's father. Ten years before the events of the main storyline, he suddenly disappeared inside a dungeon while on a raid, leaving his family to presume him dead. However, about a decade later, he returned to the human world to aid his son in the coming war against the Monarchs and was eventually revealed to be a Rulers' vessel, one of the seven humans chosen by the Rulers to serve as their hosts. Although Il-Hwan ultimately succeeded in his mission, he ended up exerting far more power than his body could handle in his last battle with the Monarchs and consequently died afterwards in his son's arms.<br>

    "Go Gunhee"<br>
    ->Go junhee (고건희) was a Korean S-Rank Hunter and the Chairman of the Korean Hunters' Association, the government agency responsible for overseeing all the hunters, gates, and guilds active within Korea. Although he was later revealed to be a Rulers' vessel, he suffered from a variety of health problems due to his old age, preventing him from using his powers to their max output, and was ultimately killed by the Monarchs.<br>

    "Thomas Andre"<br>
    ->Thomas Andre (토마스 안드레) is the strongest hunter in America and one of the five National Level Hunters, ranking 1st in the world. He is also a Rulers' vessel and is nicknamed the Goliath due to his huge build and immense strength. He later befriends Jinwoo after the latter defeats him in a fight and give him Kamish's Wrath, the strongest magical weapons in the world, as a gift.<br>

    "Antares"<br>
    ->Antares (안타레스) was the King of Dragons and the Monarch of Destruction. He was also the strongest Monarch and the final antagonist of Solo Leveling. After Jinwoo killed three of the other Monarchs, Antares invaded the human world in order to draw him out and finish him off. However, despite his best efforts, he ultimately failed in his mission and was killed by the Rulers.<br>

    "Rulers"<br>
    ->The Rulers (지배자들), also called the Fragments of Brilliant Light, are an ancient race of angelic humanoids who aim to protect the human race from being annihilated by the Monarchs. Although they have noble ambitions, they are willing to use morally questionable methods to achieve them and are indirectly responsible for the millions of human lives lost ever since monsters first began using gates to cross over to the human world. The Rulers also heavily resemble angels in appearance and are able to use an immensely powerful form of telekinesis unique to themselves called Ruler's Authority.<br>

    "Monarchs"<br>
    ->The Monarchs (군주) are an ancient race of monsters who seek to wipe out the human race for their own ends, making them the primary antagonists of the series. As a result, they have a cruel disregard for life and are generally very arrogant towards those they find inferior to themselves, especially humans. The Monarchs also each govern a different race of monsters and take after the race that they rule over in appearance.<br></p1>
